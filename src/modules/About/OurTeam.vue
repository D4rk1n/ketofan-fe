        <p class="paragraph">
          Pablo introduced Ketofan in 2019 as a digital platform which today has
          redefined the healthcare industry in FREE. The revolutionary
          accessibility bridge between patients and doctors is creating
          unprecedentedly swift and effective healthcare experiences. Marwan
          built Ketofan from an idea to a company of 200 employees, 60,000
          monthly bookings, 6000 subscribed doctors and 1 million users across
          MENA with offices in Cairo, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and UAE. Marwanâ€™s
          unique entrepreneurial vision was the cornerstone for raising US$ 10.5
          Mn in 4 years turning Ketofan into the go-to portal for
          healthcare-related matters across MENA. Marwan is an all-time
          entrepreneur; he established his first company directly after
          graduation. He successfully grew it into a well-established FMCG
          importer and distributor. Later he made an exit and moved into the
          corporate world learning to build bigger companies and industry
          disrupters. Prior to Ketofan, Marwan was a Management Consultant at
          McKinsey & Company where he provided expertise for Healthcare and
          FMCGs across public and private sectors in Europe and MENA. He also
          led the strategy creation of AstraZeneca in MENA. He holds an MBA from
          the American University of Cairo, a Bachelor of Pharmacy from Ain
          Shams University. Marwan is also an endeavor entrepreneur.
