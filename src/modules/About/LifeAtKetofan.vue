      <p class="paragraph">
        My journey in Ketofan – which started in 2013 – is truly a journey of a
        lifetime.<br />I started out as an Accountant, then Lead Accountant,
        then Accounting Manager, and now Finance Manager.<br />This fast sprint
        in my career could have never happened elsewhere.<br />What I have
        reached in 5 years would have taken me 12-15 years in any other
        company.<br />If you show passion and eagerness to learn, management
        invests time and effort in you to grow and groom you to get promoted
        irrespective of your age.
